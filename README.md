Sure! Here's an example of a README.md file for the elevator system API implementation:

# Elevator System API

The Elevator System API is a Django-based API that simulates the operations of an elevator system. It allows you to initialize the elevator system, manage elevators, add requests, and perform various actions related to the elevator operations.

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

   pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Apply database migrations by running the following command:

   python manage.py migrate

4. Start the elevator taking existing request, it will serve request every 5 seconds.

    python manage.py check_elevator_direction

    A loop will continiously serve all the requests and will run paralley to server
5. Start the development server by running the following command:

   python manage.py runserver


6. Access the API endpoints through the specified URLs.


## Note 1 : If want to re-initilise the system then use 
    elevators/reinitialise (it will take all elevator to floor 1 and make their state as stopped)

## Note 2 : If want to re-initilise the system then use 
    elevators/hard_reset  (it will delete all elevator data). Now you can Initialise new elevator system using elevators/initialize_system/



API Endpoints
The following API endpoints are available in the Elevator System API:

## Elevators
1. POST /elevators/initialize_system/
Initilise system with n elevators. 

sample payload : {
    "num_elevators": 5
}



2. GET /elevators/<elevator_id>/
Retrieves the details of a specific elevator.


3. GET /elevators/<elevator_id>/direction/
Fetches the current direction of a given elevator.


4. POST /elevators/<elevator_id>/mark_maintenance/
Marks a given elevator as in maintenance.


5. POST /elevators/<elevator_id>/open_door/
Opens the door of a given elevator. (API base has been created not used)


6. POST /elevators/<elevator_id>/close_door/
Closes the door of a given elevator.(API base has been created not used)


7. GET /elevators/<elevator_id>/get_floor_list/
Fetches all the requests associated with a given elevator.


8. POST elevators/<floor_id>/add_new_request/
Fetches all the requests associated with a given elevator.


9. POST /elevators/<elevator_id>/request_floor/
Adds a new request floor for a given elevator.
sample payload : {
    "floor_id": 4
}
Above request mean if you are inside lift and clicking button for specific floor


10. POST /elevators/add/
Adds a new elevator.
sample payload: {"direction": "stopped"} -> This is optional. Default setting will be used

11. DELETE /elevators/<elevator_id>/delete/
Deletes an existing elevator.


12. POST /elevators/reinitialize/
Reinitializes the entire elevator system.


13. POST /elevators/hard-reset/
Performs a hard reset of the elevator system.


## Project Structure

The project follows the standard Django project structure:

- ElevatorSystem
    - elevator1
        - api
        - elevator_system
            - management
                - commands
                    - init.py
                    - check_elevator_direction.py : Script to run elevator serving requests assigned
            - migrations
                - (migtaion data)
            - init.py
            - admin.py
            - apps.py
            - models.py : Defines the database models for elevators and requests.
            - serializers.py : Defines the serializers for elevators and requests.
            - tests.py 
            - utils.py : Contains utility functions for elevator operations.
            - views.py : Contains the viewsets for the elevator and request endpoints.
        - elevatorv1
            - settings.py
    - db.sqlite3
    - manage.py
    - README.md
    - requirements.txt :  Lists the required Python packages for the project.

## Database

The project uses the default SQLite database provided by Django for simplicity. If you want to use a different database, you can update the database settings in the `settings.py` file.

## Authentication and Authorization

The API endpoints do not require authentication or authorization for simplicity. In a production environment, it is recommended to implement appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure the API.

## Error Handling

The API handles common errors and returns appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages. If an error occurs, the response will include an error message in the JSON format.

## Scope of Improvement

- Better away of assigning elevator to particular request
- Authentication and Authorization
- More Apis which can give more command to admin
- Refactor code for better optimisation
- Use cache whereever possible
- Use production ready db like postgres for better security and better concurrency

## Conclusion

The Elevator System API provides a simplified implementation of an elevator system, allowing you to manage elevators, add requests, and perform elevator operations. Feel free to explore the endpoints and integrate them into your applications.
